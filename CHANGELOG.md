# Changelog

All notable changes to the Mobile Receipt Printer project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Receipt creation now records the exact timestamp at the moment the user presses the in-form "Create Receipt" action (previously it reused the time from when the screen first opened).
- Printed receipt text now uses a fresh timestamp at print time, ensuring print output reflects the actual print moment.

### Changed
- Time precision increased from minutes (HH:mm) to seconds (HH:mm:ss) for newly created and printed receipts. Existing stored receipts remain with their original minute-level time; no migration required.

### Notes
- Database schema unchanged (reused existing `date` and `time` fields). No migration required.
- Creation time and print time may differ if there is a delay between creation and printing; only creation time is persisted currently.
- Future enhancement (optional): add a nullable `printTime` column if audit of print latency becomes important.
